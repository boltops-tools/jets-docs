Note: Users who have used Jets for a while, IE, jets v3 and below, may notice that the CloudFormation keys are CamelCase not underscore. Both underscore and CamelCase works. Jets runs a custom Camelizer to properly transform the keys regardless of the format. You can use either format. Have found that once we get near CloudFormation land, it's easier to think on CloudFormation terms. Feel that `resource` at the crossing of that mental boundary.
